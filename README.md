This project demonstrates the **Law of Large Numbers (LLN)** using a simple coin toss experiment.  

- As the number of tosses increases, the sample mean converges to the true probability of \(0.5\).  
- Histograms of repeated experiments show the sampling distribution tightening and aligning with the Normal curve \(\mathcal{N}(0.5,\,0.25/n)\).  
- The project includes clear visualizations of both the **running mean** (LLN) and the **distribution of sample proportions** (CLT).  

---

## Key Features
- Interactive runs: progress through \(N = 10, 100, 1000, 10000\).  
- LLN panel: running mean approaching 0.5.  
- CLT panel: histogram with bold red Normal overlay.  
- Heads/Tails counts displayed at each run.
