This project demonstrates the **Law of Large Numbers (LLN)** using a simple coin toss experiment.  

- As the number of tosses increases, the sample mean converges to the true probability of $0.5$.  
- Histograms of repeated experiments show the sampling distribution tightening and aligning with the Normal curve $\mathcal{N}(0.5,\,0.25/n)$.  
- The project includes clear visualizations of both the **running mean** (LLN) and the **distribution of sample proportions** (CLT).  

---

## Key Features
- Interactive runs: progress through $N = 10, 100, 1000, 10000$.  
- LLN panel: running mean approaching $0.5$.  
- CLT panel: histogram with bold red Normal overlay.  
- Heads/Tails counts displayed at each run.
