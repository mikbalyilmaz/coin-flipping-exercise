# coin-flipping-exercise
This project visualizes the Law of Large Numbers (LLN) and the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) using a coin toss experiment. As the number of trials increases, the probability converges to 0.5, and the sample distributions approach the normal curve, illustrated through clear plots.
